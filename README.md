SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta Analysis for Gene EXPression) for Galaxy
========

SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression) for Galaxy is a Galaxy tool suite providing a unified way to carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their specificities. It handles microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or custom data from affymetrix microarrays. These data are then combined to carry out meta-analysis using metaMA package. SMAGEXP also offers to combine Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) RNA-seq analysis from Deseq2 results thanks to metaRNASeq package. In both cases, key values, independent from the technology type, are reported to judge the quality of the meta-analysis. 

How to install SMAGEXP?
------------------------

### Using the toolshed

[SMAGEXP is available on the galaxy main toolshed ](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/sblanck/smagexp/58052f8bc987)

SMAGEXP dependencies are available through conda either on bioconda or r conda channels.

If you want to manually install the SMAGEXP dependencies, without conda, these are the required R packages.

* From bioconductor : 
	* GEOquery 
	* limma
	* affy
	* annaffy
	* HTSFilter
	* GEOmetadb
	* affyPLM
	* recount

* From CRAN :  
	* metaMA
	* metaRNASeq
	* jsonlite
	* VennDiagram
	* dplyr
	* optparse
	* UpSetR

### Using Docker

A dockerized version of Galaxy containing SMAGEXP, based on [bgruening galaxy-stable](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable) is also available.

At first you need to install docker. Please follow the [very good instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) from the Docker project.

After the successful installation, all you need to do is:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8021:21 -p 8022:22 sblanck/galaxy-smagexp
```
Then, you just need to open a web browser (chrome or firefox are recommanded) and type 
```
localhost:8080
```
into the adress bar to access Galaxy running smagexp

The Galaxy Admin User has the username `admin@galaxy.org` and the password `admin`. In order to use some features of Galaxy, like import history, one has to be logged in.

Docker images are "read-only", all your changes inside one session will be lost after restart. This mode is useful to present Galaxy to your colleagues or to run workshops with it. To install Tool Shed repositories or to save your data you need to export the calculated data to the host computer.

Fortunately, this is as easy as:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
    -v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/ \
    sblanck/galaxy-smagexp
```
For advanced users who wants to explore Rdata objects generated by SMAGEXP thanks to Galaxy's Rstudio Interactive Environment, we need to be able to launch Docker containers inside our Galaxy Docker container. At least docker 1.3 is needed on the host system.
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8021:21 -p 8800:8800 \
    --privileged=true \
    -v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/ \
    bgruening/galaxy-stable
```

For more information about the parameters and docker usage, please refer to https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/blob/master/README.md#Usage


How to analyse data with SMAGEXP
------------------------

###  Micro-array meta-analysis

SMAGEXP is able to perform analysis from 3 different data source :
* From GEO database
* From .CEL files
* From custom matrix text files

##### Data from GEO database

SMAGEXP can fetch data directly from [GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), thanks to the GEOQuery R package. 

The inputs are : 

* The GEO Series Accession ID of the microarray experiment
* log2 transformation option : Limma expects data values to be in log space. If the values of the experiments are not in log space, SMAGEXP is able to check and to transform them accordingly (option auto). The user can also choose to force the transformation (option yes) or to override the auto detect feature (option no)

The outputs are :

* A tabular file containing the values of each probes (lines) for each samples (columns) of the experiment
* A .rdata file containing a bioconductor eset object. This file is required for further differential analysis.
* A tabular text file (.cond extension) summarizing the conditions of the experiment.

Exemple of a .cond file
```

GSM80460	series of 16 tumors		GSM80460 OSCE-2T SERIES OF 16 TUMORS
GSM80461	series of 16 tumors		GSM80461 OSCE-4T Series of 16 Tumors
GSM80461	series of 16 tumors		GSM80462 OSCE-6T Series of 16 Tumors
GSM80476	series of 4 normals		GSM80476 OSCE-2N Series of 4 Normals
GSM80477 	series of 4 normals		GSM80477 OSCE-9N Series of 4 Normals

```
.cond file is a text file, containing 3 columns, separate by tabs, summarizing the conditions of the experiment. 
* 1st column is the ID of the sample
* 2nd column is the condition of the sample
* 3rd column is a description of the sample

When extracting data from GEO database, SMAGEXP automatically generates a .cond files based on the metadata of the experiment. 

#### Data from affymetrix .CEL files
SMAGEXP handles affymetrix .CEL files. .CEL files have to be normalized with QCnormalization tool. This tool normalizes data and allows the user to check quality.

The inputs are
* A list of .CEL files
* The normalization methods
	- rma normalization
	- quantile normalization + log2
	- background correction + log2
	- log2 only

The outputs are 
- Several quality figures : microarray images, boxplots and MA plots
- Rdata object containing the normalized data for further analysis
- Text file containing normalized data

#### Custom matrix data
Import custom data tool imports data stored in a tabular text file. A few  normalization methods are proposed, but it is possible to skip the normalization step, by choosing "none" in the normalization methods options. Therefore this tool is of special interest when the input dataset has been previously normalized.

The inputs are :
* A text file, with probes in row and samples in columns. Column titles (chip IDs) must match the IDs of the .cond file.
* a .cond file, previously manually generated by the user.
* Normalization method (choose none if the data is already normalized)
* A GPL annotation code to fetch annotations from GEO.

### Rna-seq meta analysis 
The RNA-seq data meta-analysis tool relies on DESeq2 results.

It outputs a Venn diagram or an upsetR diagram (when the number of studies is greater than 2) and the same indicators as in the microarray meta-analysis tool for both Fisher and inverse normal p-values combinations.

The inputs are :
- At least 2 studies, and for each study
	- Results of DESeq2 study
	- Number of replicates of the study	
- A FDR Threshold	

The outputs are  :		
- Venn Diagram or upsetR diagram (when the number of studies is greater than 3) summarizing the results of the meta-analysis
- A list of indicators to evaluate the quality of the performance of the meta-analysis
		
	- DE : Number of differentially expressed genes 
	- IDD (Integration Driven discoveries) : number of genes that are declared differentially expressed in the meta-analysis that were not identified in any of the single studies alone
	- Loss : Number of genes that are identified differentially expressed in single studies but not in meta-analysis 
	- DR (Integration-driven Discovery Rate) : corresponding proportion of IDD
	- IRR (Integration-driven Revision) : corresponding proportion of Loss

It also generates a text file containing summarization of the results of each single analysis and meta-analysis. Potential conflicts between single analyses are indicated by zero values in the "signFC" column.
